On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20 April - 26 April 2020 ~
This week I think about what will make our project more useful. In additon to this, I started to learn how to use Android Studio.

### ~ 27 April - 3 May 2020 ~
This week I learn more difficult levels of Android Studio and I begin to practice it. 
On May 1, I started to code. First, on Android Studio, I prepare the layout that my group members sketch on paper. 
On May 2, working on Recycler View and realtime database called Firebase.

### ~ 4 May - 10 May 2020 ~
This week I will continue to design the pages that users will use. 
On May 5, we thought about how we should use classes effectively. 
On May 6-8, I noticed that we do not need to use Recycler View. We can use just fragments and add them to our linear layouts according to informations coming from our data bases.

On May 9, I just worked on bug fixes.
On May 10, we decided to use Recycler View again. I must figure it out. I research for doing this.

### ~ 11 May - 17 May 2020 ~
On 13 May, I figured how we can update data in real time. We should use Firestore Recycler View so that we can get data from our online database.

On 14 May - 17 May, I designed and implemented "group chat". First, Burak designed looking of the page. I prepared the necessary codes (Adapter, model classes, activity). I designed what I need to save data on our online database. Finally, I have finished real time chat page functionally with Firestore Recycler View.
### ~ 18 May - 24 May 2020 ~
On 18 May, I worked on "message notification support" with Berke. Also, I designed and implemented notification page which can be updated in real time with Firestore Recycler View. I designed and implemented "My Tasks" page which can be updated in real time with Firestore Recycler View. I added the progress bar and remaining day bar on "ProJet" page. Bug fixes about all pages.

On 19 May, I turned the main page to Firestore Recycler View so that we can follow the ProJets every time and no need to close and open the application again. I designed and implemented "Current Tasks" and "Profile" pages which can be updated in real time.

On 20-21 May, I worked on bug fixes and the demo video. 
On 22-24 May, because we complete the application, I just worked on minor bug fixes.

>> For the records, all pages that I designed and implemented have data which can be updated in real time. I used Firestore Recycler View to send information to Firebase and get data from there.
