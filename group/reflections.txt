***REFLECTIONS***

**Useful Learning Experience**
The journey of developing a complete program with little to no experience as a group sounded challenging or almost impossible at first.
And it is true that we really had a hard time on certain points, but as the time passed, we realised we that we have learned so many
things on our own, and as a group. The best part of this group project is that it pushes us to learn "independently", and
we believe that this is one of the best lessons a human can learn.

**Dislikes**
It might have been a relief to have some provided guides or tutorials to know where to start, but this is also another part of the project
to push us tolearn independently, probably.

**Most Difficult Aspect**
The most difficult part of this project was to put in the time and effort to learn something from scratch in a short amount of time,
and distribute the tasks between group members fairly and in a plausible way so that we could work as efficiently as possible.

**What Would We Do Differently?**
GitHub is a lifesaver when it comes to working on a coding project as a group. It took us a time to learn and use it properly.
Because we didn't pay enough attention to the importance of GitHub and its features, we lost some time on copying & cleaning code conflicts
that has occured during the project. So if we were to start again, we would have spent a little bit more time on correct usage of GitHub.

Also, it might have been better if we searched for other old but common database systems rather than Firebase, but we are not regretful for
using Firebase, it was just a little bit harder than the other alternatives since there were not so many tutorials about it.

**Spent Time**
We are not sure about the overall spent time as a group, but almost all active members spent more than 4 hrs each day in the last month
of the developement and coding process.

**Finally**
We are proud of what we have achieved: A fully complete and working android app that can actually be used by people!
