On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20 April - 26 April 2020 ~
This week I think about what will make our project more useful. In additon to this, I started to learn how to use Android Studio.

### ~ 27 April - 3 May 2020 ~
