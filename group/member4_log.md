On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20 April - 26 April 2020 ~
This week I think about what will make our project more useful. In additon to this, I started to learn how to use Android Studio.

### ~ 27 April - 3 May 2020 ~
This week I learn more difficult levels of Android Studio and I begin to practice it. 
On 1 May, I started to code. First, on Android Studio, I prepare the layout that my group members sketch on paper. 
On 2 May, working on Recycler View and realtime database called Firebase.

### ~ 4 May - 11 May 2020 ~
This week I will continue to design the pages that users will use. 
On 5 May, we thought about how we should use classes effectively. 
On 6-8 May, I noticed that we do not need to use Recycler View. We can use just fragments and add them to our linear layouts according to informations coming from our data bases.

On 9 May, I just worked on bug fixes.
