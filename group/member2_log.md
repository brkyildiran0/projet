On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20 April - 26 April 2020 ~
This week I start the learn how to design with android studio. Start create login-regisgter desing. Instead of using drag and drop (mostly ConstraintLayout) style ı use LinearLayout with writing xml code to learn more. Also started to learn SQLite.
### ~ 27 April - 3 May 2020  ~
This week I completed login-register android app with using SQLite database. Thats helps me to understand and do practice with SQLite statements and commands. If We not choose google based sing in we have ready login-register code. 
At the end of week we decided to use Firebase instead of any SQL based database systems and ı create Firebase account, start to discover it.
### ~ 4 May - 10 May~
4 May -> I compeleted the login-register part of the app using Firebase Authentication.
5-7 May -> After many research about Firebase me and Ömer Burak Yıldıran created a tree diagram in Firestore. To see how can we implement it for our case.
7-10 may -> Bug fixed some, help my friends creating layout designs

### ~ 11 May - 17 May~
Login - register system fixed now works fine.
Started to research for about notifications system and implement, create android based notifications.

### ~ 18 May - 24 May~
ı tryed to used Firebase system to push notification but the ı realized, it will cause to change our tree design so ı go back researching and then, ı found OneSignal. I implement it to out app after some bug fixeses it works well. 
Then we need te figure out how we going to how we store all notifications. Therefore I created MyNotification Class with help of Yüksel Berkay, now we able to send device to device notification (ıf you added an projet, or new message etc.) and also store them in Firebase database..
Then we figure out to send notification to calculated date. Now our app sends notifications when 2 days left for deadline of ProJet and
2 hours left for deadline of created Task..
